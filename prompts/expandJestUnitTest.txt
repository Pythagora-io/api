I will give you the node.js code of an automated unit tests writen using Jest testing framework along with other functions that are called from it.
You need to extend it with any new automated unit tests you may think of using Jest testing framework.
Here is the code of the file `{{{testFileName}}}` with current tests:
```javascript
{{{testCode}}}
```
{{#if relatedCode.length}}
As you can see `{{{testFileName}}}` use functions from other javascript files. You can find source code of that functions below
{{/if}}
{{#if importedFiles.length}}
Here are paths to each of the other files (in case you need to require them):
```javascript
{{#each importedFiles}}
    {{#if ../isES6Syntax}}
        {{#if this.exportedAsObject}}
        import { {{{this.funcName}}} } from '{{{this.fileName}}}' -> import ... from '{{{this.pathRelativeToTest}}}';
        
        {{else}}
import ... from '{{{this.fileName}}}' -> import ... from '{{{this.pathRelativeToTest}}}';
    {{/if}}
    {{else}}
require('{{{this.fileName}}}') -> require('{{{this.pathRelativeToTest}}}');
    {{/if}}
{{/each}}
```
{{/if}}
{{#each relatedCode}}
Here is the source code of a function `{{{this.funcName}}}` which is placed inside `{{{this.fileName}}}`:
```javascript
{{{this.code}}}
```
{{#if this.relatedFunctions.length}}
{{#each this.relatedFunctions}}
Here is the source code of a function `{{{this.funcName}}}` which is placed inside `{{{this.fileName}}}`:
```javascript
{{{this.code}}}
```
Please, don't create test cases for this function.
{{/each}}
{{/if}}
{{/each}}
{{#if relatedCode.length}}
You don't need to use any of these functions, but only the ones that you are using in resulting code.
{{/if}}
Don't import any new functions inside resulting code except already imported ones.
The goal is to generate as many new automated unit tests as possible while adhering to Jest testing framework best practices.
Ensure each new test case has a logical and human-readable name and the resulting code is free from mistakes.
Please make sure that all the resulting code is wrapped within a `describe` block following Jest's testing framework best practices.
Remember, do not include any existing code from {{{testFileName}}} in the resulting code.
Make sure you generate a tests only for a function defined in {{{testFileName}}}.
